## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a laboratory sample processing pipeline with specialized PDF extraction and quality control workflows.

## Core Business Components

### Sample Processing Pipeline
Location: `src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py`
- Extracts laboratory data from standardized PDF forms
- Processes concentration, volume and quality measurements
- Maps extracted data to domain models
Importance Score: 85

### Quality Control System
Location: `src/domain/models/sample.py`
- Enforces laboratory QC thresholds:
  - Minimum concentration requirements (ng/µL)
  - Volume thresholds (µL)
  - A260/A280 quality ratio validation
- Calculates quality scores and failure reasons
Importance Score: 90

### Laboratory Workflow Management  
Location: `src/domain/models/submission.py`
- Controls sample states (received, processing, sequenced)
- Manages laboratory metadata:
  - Human DNA detection
  - Organism classification
  - Service requirements
Importance Score: 80

### Measurement Processing
Location: `src/domain/models/value_objects.py`
- Validates concentration measurements with units
- Processes volume thresholds
- Handles quality ratio acceptable ranges
- Tracks storage location hierarchy
Importance Score: 70

## Domain Integration Points

### Table Header Recognition
Location: `pdf_slurper/mapping.py`
- Normalizes variant laboratory column headers
- Matches fuzzy header terminology
- Processes specialized unit notations
Importance Score: 75

### Quality Control Workflow
Location: `pdf_slurper/db.py`
- Implements pass/warning/fail status tracking
- Manages QC threshold validations
- Processes sample group batches
Importance Score: 80

The system specializes in laboratory sample management with emphasis on standardized measurement processing, quality control enforcement, and workflow tracking specific to genetic/molecular biology operations.
