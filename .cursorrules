## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Laboratory Information Management System

Core business logic centers around three primary domains:

### 1. PDF Laboratory Data Extraction
**Importance Score: 85/100**

Located in `src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py` and `pdf_slurper/slurp.py`

Specialized parsing of laboratory documents:
- Scientific measurement extraction (concentrations, volumes, quality ratios)
- Sample table identification across multi-page reports
- Laboratory metadata parsing for submissions
- Standardized mapping of extracted data to domain models

### 2. Sample Quality Control Processing
**Importance Score: 90/100**

Located in `src/domain/models/sample.py`

Multi-factor quality assessment system:
- Concentration validation (Qubit/Nanodrop measurements)
- Volume threshold verification
- DNA quality ratio analysis (A260/A280, A260/230)
- Automated quality scoring with pass/fail determination
- Sample status workflow management
- Laboratory storage tracking

### 3. Laboratory Submission Management
**Importance Score: 85/100**

Located in `src/domain/models/submission.py`

Specialized submission handling:
- Batch quality control processing
- Scientific measurement aggregation
- Laboratory workflow state management
- Sample organization tracking
- Statistical analysis of quality metrics
- Storage location management
- Expiration tracking

The system implements domain-specific logic for laboratory sample processing, with emphasis on:
- Quality control thresholds
- Scientific measurement validation
- Laboratory workflow transitions
- Sample storage tracking
- PDF data extraction rules
- Comprehensive audit trails
