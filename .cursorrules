## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The PDF Slurper system implements specialized business logic for processing laboratory sample data through several key components:

### Core Business Components

1. PDF Sample Processing (Importance Score: 90)
- Extracts laboratory metadata and sample data from structured PDF tables
- Maps extracted data to standardized sample formats
- Implements idempotency checks using SHA-256 hashing
- Located in `pdf_slurper/slurp.py`

2. Quality Control Processing (Importance Score: 85)
- Applies multi-factor QC evaluations including:
  - Concentration thresholds
  - Volume minimums 
  - A260/A280 quality ratios
- Calculates weighted quality scores
- Located in `src/domain/services/qc_service.py`

3. Sample Workflow Management (Importance Score: 80)
- Manages sample lifecycle stages
- Handles batch operations for multiple samples
- Enforces workflow state transitions
- Located in `src/domain/services/sample_tracking.py`

4. Submission Processing (Importance Score: 75)
- Aggregates samples into submissions
- Generates submission statistics and QC reports
- Manages submission metadata
- Located in `src/domain/models/submission.py`

### Integration Components

1. Table Extraction (Importance Score: 85)
- Normalizes laboratory table headers
- Maps columns to standardized fields
- Located in `pdf_slurper/mapping.py`

2. Data Export (Importance Score: 75)
- Generates sample manifests
- Exports QC reports
- Located in `pdf_slurper/exporters.py`

The system maintains separation between core laboratory data processing and supporting infrastructure, with business logic concentrated in dedicated service and model components.
