# ✅ Samples Display Issue - RESOLVED!

## Current Status: WORKING ✅

The samples API is now functioning correctly and returning full sample data including:
- Sample names
- Volumes 
- Nanodrop concentrations
- All measurement data

## View a Working Submission

To see samples with complete data, view this submission:

**http://localhost:8080/submission.html?id=97c30e3a-9c8b-44fd-85ad-5dc1fcaa4029**

This submission has:
- ✅ **96 samples** with real data
- ✅ **Sample names**: 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, etc.
- ✅ **Volumes**: 2.0 µL
- ✅ **Nanodrop concentrations**: 298.9, 314.05, 348.2 ng/µL

## What Was Fixed

1. **Route Ordering** - Moved `/{submission_id}/samples` route before the general `/{submission_id}` route to prevent route conflicts

2. **API Endpoint** - Added debug information and proper error handling to the samples endpoint

3. **Database Connection** - Verified and fixed the database connection in the API layer

## Known Issues with Some Submissions

Some older submissions may show empty sample details because they were created during the bug where metadata was incorrectly saved as samples. These show:
- Wrong names like "Joshua Leon", "joshleon@unc.edu" 
- All measurements as null

## Creating New Submissions

New submissions created now will have proper sample extraction:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/submissions/ \
  -F "pdf_file=@HTSF--JL-147_quote_160217072025.pdf" \
  -F "storage_location=Test Location" \
  -F "auto_qc=false" \
  -F "force=true"
```

## API Response Example

The samples endpoint now returns proper data:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "c6128a74-05e5-4285-89ae-677fb2a04194",
            "name": "1",
            "volume_ul": 2.0,
            "qubit_ng_per_ul": null,
            "nanodrop_ng_per_ul": 298.9,
            "a260_a280": null,
            "a260_a230": null,
            "status": "received"
        },
        // ... more samples
    ],
    "total": 96
}
```

## Summary

✅ **Samples API is working**  
✅ **Data is being displayed correctly**  
✅ **New submissions will have proper sample data**

The system is now fully operational for viewing and managing laboratory sample submissions!
