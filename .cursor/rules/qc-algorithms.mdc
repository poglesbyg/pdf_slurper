## Core QC Algorithms

Location: src/domain/models/sample.py
Importance Score: 90

### Threshold Validation System
- Enforces laboratory QC thresholds:
  - Minimum concentration checks (ng/µL)
  - Volume requirements (µL) per sample type
  - A260/A280 ratio validation for nucleic acid purity
  - A260/A230 contamination detection

### Quality Score Calculation
- Multi-parameter scoring incorporating:
  - Raw concentration values
  - Volume measurements
  - Purity ratios
  - Sample type specific modifiers

### Batch Processing Logic
Location: src/domain/models/submission.py
Importance Score: 85

- Validates sample groups against collective thresholds
- Manages aggregate quality scores for batch submissions
- Implements failure cascading rules for grouped samples
- Tracks QC status with detailed failure reasons

### Domain-Specific QC Rules
Location: src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py
Importance Score: 80

- Laboratory-specific measurement validation:
  - Qubit vs Nanodrop concentration reconciliation
  - Unit standardization and conversion
  - Scientific notation parsing
  - Measurement precision requirements

### Quality Control Workflow
- Sequential validation stages:
  1. Raw measurement validation
  2. Type-specific threshold checks
  3. Ratio analysis
  4. Aggregate quality scoring
  5. Pass/Warning/Fail determination

The QC system implements specialized laboratory requirements for genetic/molecular biology sample validation with emphasis on measurement accuracy and sample quality assurance.
