## Quality Control Processing Core
Location: src/domain/models/sample.py

Quality control evaluation system implements multi-factor analysis:

1. Concentration Assessment
- Primary measurement via Qubit readings
- Secondary validation through Nanodrop values 
- Configurable minimum threshold (default 10.0 ng/µL)
- Automated quality grade assignment (A-F)

2. Volume Validation
- Minimum volume requirements (default 20.0 µL)
- Storage capacity constraints
- Container type specific thresholds

3. Quality Ratio Analysis 
- A260/280 ratio validation (acceptable range 1.8-2.0)
- A260/230 secondary purity check
- Automated flagging of out-of-range samples

Importance Score: 95/100

## Quality Scoring Algorithm
Location: src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py

Calculates normalized quality scores (0-100) using weighted factors:

1. Primary Metrics
- Concentration weight: 40%
- Volume adequacy: 30%
- Quality ratios: 30%

2. Status Classifications
- PASS: Score >= 80
- WARNING: Score 60-79
- FAIL: Score < 60

3. Batch Processing Logic
- Aggregated QC results for submission sets
- Statistical outlier detection
- Cross-validation between samples
- Automated flagging of anomalous results

Importance Score: 85/100

## Sample Status Workflow
Location: src/domain/models/submission.py

Manages laboratory sample progression:

1. State Transitions
- RECEIVED → Initial QC
- PROCESSING → Active Analysis
- SEQUENCED → Data Generation
- COMPLETED → Final QC Review

2. Quality Control Gates
- Entry criteria for each stage
- Required QC metrics per transition
- Validation rules for progression
- Rollback handling for failed QC

Importance Score: 80/100
