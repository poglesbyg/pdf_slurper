## Core QC Algorithms

### Quality Score Calculation
File: `pdf_slurper/cli_v2.py`, `pdf_slurper/db.py`
- Calculates sample quality scores based on:
  - Concentration levels (ng/μL)
  - Volume measurements (μL)
  - A260/A280 ratio
- Weighted scoring formula factors all three metrics
- Each metric has configurable thresholds and weights
Importance Score: 90

### Batch QC Processing
File: `pdf_slurper/cli_v2.py`
- Processes multiple samples simultaneously for QC validation
- Applies threshold checks across sample batches
- Updates QC status based on aggregate results
Importance Score: 85

### QC Status Management
File: `pdf_slurper/db.py`
- Tracks QC status transitions:
  - PENDING → PROCESSING → PASSED/FAILED
- Maintains history of QC checks
- Links QC results to specific threshold sets
Importance Score: 80

### Statistical Analysis
File: `pdf_slurper/cli_v2.py`
- Calculates submission-level QC metrics:
  - Pass/fail rates
  - Average quality scores
  - Distribution of failures by metric
- Generates QC summary reports
Importance Score: 75

### Threshold Configuration
File: `src/domain/models/sample.py`
- Defines domain-specific threshold ranges
- Configurable minimum/maximum values for:
  - Concentration thresholds
  - Volume requirements
  - Quality ratios
Importance Score: 85

### Batch Status Updates
File: `pdf_slurper/cli_v2.py`
- Updates QC status for multiple samples
- Validates status transitions
- Maintains consistency across related samples
Importance Score: 70
