# Data-flow

## Primary Data Flow Sequence

1. PDF Upload & Initial Processing
- Path: src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py
- PDF laboratory report uploaded via web interface
- Specialized PDF parser extracts:
  * Sample tables with concentrations and volumes
  * Quality ratios (A260/A280, A260/230)
  * Laboratory metadata and requester information
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Sample Data Transformation
- Path: src/domain/models/sample.py
- Raw PDF data converted to domain objects
- Applies laboratory-specific validations:
  * Concentration thresholds 
  * Volume requirements
  * Quality ratio specifications
- Generates normalized quality scores
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Quality Control Processing
- Path: src/domain/services/submission_service.py
- Executes multi-stage QC workflow:
  * Concentration validation
  * Volume validation  
  * Quality ratio assessment
- Produces QC status (PASS/WARNING/FAIL)
- Updates sample workflow state
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Storage & Persistence
- Path: src/infrastructure/persistence/models.py
- Records final sample data with:
  * QC results
  * Storage location assignments
  * Processing history
  * Workflow state
- Maintains audit trail of status changes
Importance Score: 75/100

## Data Transformations

Key Measurement Conversions:
- Concentration units (ng/µL)
- Volume standardization (µL)
- Quality ratio normalization
- Storage location encoding (Freezer/Shelf/Box/Position)

Sample Status Transitions:
RECEIVED → PROCESSING → SEQUENCED → COMPLETED
