description: Analyzes data flow from PDF upload through extraction, transformation, QC, and storage

# Data Flow

## Primary Data Flow Path

1. PDF Upload & Initial Processing
- File arrives via CLI/web upload (`pdf_slurper/cli_v2.py`, `pdf_slurper/server.py`)
- PDF content extracted using PyMuPDF/PDFPlumber strategies (`src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py`)
Importance Score: 85

2. Data Extraction & Transformation
- Tables identified and extracted from PDF
- Headers normalized and mapped to sample fields
- Data transformed into structured Sample objects
- Content hash generated for idempotency checks
Importance Score: 90

3. Quality Control Processing
- QC thresholds applied to concentration, volume, A260/280 ratio
- Quality scores calculated for each sample
- Samples flagged based on QC criteria
- QC results stored with sample records
Importance Score: 85

4. Database Storage
- Submissions and samples saved to SQLite database
- Metadata associated with submission record
- Sample data stored with relationships to submission
- Hash checks prevent duplicate storage
Importance Score: 75

5. Statistics & Reporting Flow
- Submission statistics calculated (averages, counts)
- QC status aggregated across samples
- Results transformed for CSV/JSON export
- Manifest generation for approved samples
Importance Score: 80

## Key Integration Points

1. PDF Processing Pipeline
```
Upload -> Content Extraction -> Table Detection -> Data Normalization -> Sample Creation
```

2. QC Processing Pipeline
```
Sample Data -> Threshold Application -> Score Calculation -> Status Update -> Storage
```

3. Export Pipeline
```
Database Query -> Data Aggregation -> Format Transformation -> File Generation
```

## Error Handling Flow
- Invalid PDFs rejected at upload
- Malformed data caught during extraction
- QC failures logged with samples
- Database transaction rollback on errors
Importance Score: 75
