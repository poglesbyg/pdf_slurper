# Data Flow

## Primary Data Pipeline

1. PDF Upload & Initial Processing
- Location: src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py
- PDF submissions received through web interface
- Raw PDF parsed for laboratory sample tables and metadata
- Extracts concentration, volume, quality metrics
Importance Score: 85

2. Data Transformation
- Location: src/domain/models/sample.py
- Raw extracted values mapped to domain entities
- QC thresholds applied:
  - Concentration validation (ng/µL)
  - Volume requirements (µL)
  - A260/A280 ratio analysis
- Quality scores calculated
Importance Score: 90

3. Domain Processing
- Location: src/domain/models/submission.py
- Sample data grouped into submissions
- Workflow state tracking:
  - received → processing → sequenced → completed
- Laboratory metadata enrichment:
  - Human DNA flags
  - Organism classification
  - Service requirements
Importance Score: 80

4. Storage Layer
- Location: src/infrastructure/persistence/repositories/submission_repository.py
- Final validated data persisted
- Maintains submission history
- Tracks sample locations and processing status
Importance Score: 75

## Legacy Integration Flow
- Location: src/adapter.py
- Parallel processing during transition
- Legacy PDF processor compatibility
- Dual-database synchronization
Importance Score: 70
