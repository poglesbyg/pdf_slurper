## Core PDF Processing Components

### 1. Metadata Extraction Algorithm 
File: `pdf_slurper/slurp.py`
- Extracts front-matter text using label detection 
- Accumulates subsequent lines to build complete field values
- Identifies key metadata fields like requester info, lab details
Importance Score: 85

### 2. Table Detection and Parsing
File: `pdf_slurper/slurp.py`
- Identifies sample data tables through heuristic header matching
- Maps normalized column headers to standardized sample fields
- Handles merged cells and multi-line entries
Importance Score: 90

### 3. Header Normalization 
File: `pdf_slurper/mapping.py`
- Normalizes table headers through fuzzy matching
- Maps logical field names to column indices
- Handles variations in header naming conventions
Importance Score: 75

### 4. Data Transformation Pipeline
File: `pdf_slurper/slurp.py`
- Converts extracted table data into Sample objects
- Associates samples with Submission metadata
- Implements idempotency checks using content hashing
Importance Score: 80

### 5. Quality Control Processing
File: `pdf_slurper/db.py`
- Applies QC thresholds to concentration, volume, A260/A280 ratio
- Calculates composite quality scores
- Flags samples failing threshold criteria
Importance Score: 85

### 6. Sample Mapping Logic
File: `pdf_slurper/mapping.py`
- Derives mappings between PDF fields and sample attributes
- Handles laboratory-specific field naming variations
- Maps numeric fields to appropriate data types
Importance Score: 70

The system implements specialized algorithms for processing laboratory sample PDFs, focusing on structured data extraction, normalization, and quality control validation. The core functionality revolves around accurate metadata extraction and sample data parsing from standardized laboratory documents.
