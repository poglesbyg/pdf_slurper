## PDF Laboratory Data Extraction
Path: pdf_slurper/slurp.py
Importance Score: 90/100

Core algorithms for processing laboratory sample PDFs:

1. Metadata Extraction
- Parses standardized lab form fields for requester details, service types
- Extracts DNA/RNA sample specifications and buffer information
- Maps form metadata to domain-specific submission schema

2. Table Detection & Processing
- Identifies sample data tables using laboratory-specific header patterns
- Normalizes column headers for concentration, volume, quality metrics
- Maps extracted table data to standardized sample records

3. Quality Measurements Processing
- Extracts concentration values (ng/ÂµL) from Qubit/Nanodrop readings
- Parses A260/280 and A260/230 ratios for nucleic acid purity
- Validates measurement formats against lab-specific patterns

## Laboratory QC Processing
Path: src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Quality Control Validation
- Evaluates sample measurements against configurable thresholds:
  - Minimum concentration requirements
  - Volume specifications
  - Quality ratio acceptance ranges
- Assigns QC status based on laboratory criteria

2. Metadata Validation
- Verifies presence of required laboratory submission fields
- Validates sample type classifications
- Confirms human DNA presence flags

3. Sample Data Transformation
- Standardizes measurement units
- Normalizes quality ratios
- Maps extracted values to domain models

The algorithms focus specifically on laboratory sample data processing from standardized PDF forms, with emphasis on quality control validation and measurement standardization for DNA/RNA samples.
