## PDF Sample Data Extraction
Importance Score: 85

Key Components:
1. Table Structure Detection
- Laboratory-specific table recognition patterns 
- Custom header mapping for standardizing different table formats
- Detection of sample data grids containing concentration/volume metrics

2. Metadata Extraction
- Requester information parsing
- Laboratory details identification
- Service request categorization
- Sample submission form validation

3. Header Normalization System
- Domain-specific column header standardization
- Fuzzy matching for variant headers like "qubit conc", "nanodrop conc"
- Laboratory unit notation parsing (µL, ng/µL)

4. Data Transformation Pipeline
Located in: pdf_slurper/slurp.py
- Extracts raw tabular data from PDF forms
- Maps column headers to standardized fields
- Validates measurement units and formats
- Converts extracted data into domain models

## Quality Control Integration
Importance Score: 80

The PDF processing algorithms integrate with QC workflows through:
- Detection of concentration measurements (Qubit/Nanodrop)
- Extraction of quality ratios (A260/A280, A260/A230)
- Volume measurement parsing with unit validation
- Automated flagging of out-of-range values

Primary Components:
pdf_slurper/mapping.py
- Header standardization rules
- Unit conversion mappings
- Laboratory-specific data format recognition

pdf_slurper/slurp.py
- Core PDF parsing engine
- Table structure detection
- Data extraction pipeline
- Quality metric identification
