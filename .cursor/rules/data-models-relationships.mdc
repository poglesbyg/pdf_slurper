## Core Data Models

### Submission Model
Location: src/domain/models/submission.py
- Represents a laboratory sample submission request
- States: received, processing, sequenced, completed
- Contains metadata: requester info, organism details, human DNA presence
- Manages relationships to Sample models
- Tracks overall submission status and QC validation results
Importance Score: 85

### Sample Model  
Location: src/domain/models/sample.py
- Represents individual laboratory samples within a submission
- Key attributes:
  - Concentration measurements (ng/µL)
  - Volume measurements (µL)
  - A260/A280 quality ratios
  - QC status with failure reasons
- Lifecycle states: pending QC -> QC passed/failed
- References parent Submission model
Importance Score: 90

### Value Objects
Location: src/domain/models/value_objects.py
- Concentration: Validates and stores concentration with units
- Volume: Enforces minimum thresholds
- QualityRatio: Validates A260/A280 and A260/A230 ranges
- StorageLocation: Manages freezer/shelf/box hierarchy
Importance Score: 75

## Relationships

### Submission -> Sample
- One-to-many relationship
- Submission acts as aggregate root
- Samples inherit workflow state from parent submission
- QC validation aggregated from child samples

### Sample -> Quality Controls
- One-to-many relationship with QC measurements
- QC failures affect sample and parent submission status
- Tracks historical QC results

### Storage Location Hierarchy
- Three-level nested structure: Freezer -> Shelf -> Box
- Samples assigned unique positions within structure
- Enforces capacity constraints per level
