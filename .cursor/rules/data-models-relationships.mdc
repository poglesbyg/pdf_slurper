## Core Data Models

### Submission Model
**Importance Score: 90**
- Represents a laboratory submission containing multiple samples
- Key attributes:
  - Submission ID
  - Requester information
  - Lab details
  - Service requests
  - Creation timestamp
  - Content hash for idempotency
  - Status tracking
  - Associated samples collection

### Sample Model
**Importance Score: 95**
- Represents individual laboratory samples within a submission
- Domain-specific attributes:
  - Sample ID
  - Concentration (ng/μL)
  - Volume (μL) 
  - A260/A280 ratio
  - QC status
  - Processing status
  - Storage location
  - Organism classification
  - Human DNA content flag
  - Expiration tracking

## Relationships

### Submission-Sample Relationship
**Importance Score: 85**
- One-to-many relationship between Submission and Sample
- Submission aggregates multiple samples
- Samples maintain reference to parent submission
- Cascade deletion of samples when submission is deleted

### State Management
**Importance Score: 80**
- Sample states:
  - Initial receipt
  - QC pending
  - QC passed/failed
  - Processing
  - Sequencing
  - Completed
- State transitions controlled by business rules
- QC status determined by concentration, volume and quality ratio thresholds

### Domain Value Objects
**Importance Score: 75**
- Concentration with unit validation
- Volume with minimum thresholds
- Quality ratios with acceptable ranges
- Location tracking with format validation
- Organism classification with predefined categories
