## Core Data Models

### Submission Model
Location: src/domain/models/submission.py

Represents a laboratory submission containing sample data extracted from PDF reports:

Key Attributes:
- submissionId: Unique identifier
- status: Workflow state (RECEIVED, PROCESSING, SEQUENCED, COMPLETED) 
- samples: Collection of associated Sample records
- metadata: Laboratory-specific submission details
- qcStatus: Aggregated quality control result
- expirationDate: Time-sensitive sample validity period

Importance Score: 90/100

### Sample Model  
Location: src/domain/models/sample.py

Represents individual laboratory samples within a submission:

Key Attributes:
- concentration: Scientific measurement with units (ng/ÂµL)
- volume: Quantity measurement with minimum thresholds
- qualityRatios: A260/280 and A260/230 measurements
- qcScore: Calculated quality score (0-100)
- storageLocation: Hierarchical storage position
- processingState: Current workflow stage

Importance Score: 85/100

### Key Relationships

1. Submission-Sample Hierarchy
- One-to-many relationship between Submission and Sample
- Samples inherit submission metadata
- QC status aggregation flows up from samples
- Storage tracking linked through samples

2. Quality Control Chain
- Sample measurements determine individual QC scores
- Sample QC scores aggregate to submission level
- QC thresholds enforced at both levels
- Full audit trail maintained for QC decisions

3. Workflow State Management
- Coordinated state transitions between levels
- Sample states influence submission status
- Expiration handling affects all related records
- Processing history tracked across relationships
