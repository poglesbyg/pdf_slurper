# Security Incident Response - Exposed Secrets

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS COMPLETED

### 1. ✅ Removed Exposed Secrets
- Deleted `deployment_secrets.txt` from repository
- Removed file from Git history completely
- Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub

### 2. ✅ Generated New Secrets
- Created completely new API_KEY, JWT_SECRET, and SECRET_KEY
- Old compromised keys are no longer in use

### 3. ✅ Secured New Secrets
- Stored new secrets in OpenShift secret object `pdf-slurper-secrets`
- Updated deployment to use secrets from OpenShift
- Secrets are now properly managed and not in source code

### 4. ✅ Prevention Measures
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future secret commits
- Added patterns: `*.secrets`, `*.key`, `*_secret*`, `.env*`
- Created `secrets-template.yaml` as a safe template for documentation

## 🔒 WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW

### 1. **Revoke Compromised Keys on GitHub**
- Go to the GitHub security alert
- Click "Revoke the secret" to mark them as compromised
- This prevents them from being used even if someone copied them

### 2. **Review Access Logs**
- Check your OpenShift logs for any suspicious activity
- Command: `oc logs deployment/pdf-slurper-v2 -n dept-barc --since=48h | grep -i "auth\|token\|unauthorized"`

### 3. **Update Any External Services**
If these secrets were used for external services:
- Change passwords/keys on those services immediately
- Update any CI/CD pipelines that might use these secrets

## 📋 NEW SECRET MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Use OpenShift/Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- ✅ Use environment variables that reference secrets
- ✅ Keep `.gitignore` updated with secret patterns
- ✅ Use secret scanning tools before commits
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly

### DON'T:
- ❌ Never commit actual secret values to Git
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in source code
- ❌ Never share secrets via email or chat
- ❌ Never use the same secret across environments

## 🛡️ SECURITY STATUS

| Component | Status | Action Taken |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Git Repository | ✅ CLEANED | Secrets removed from history |
| OpenShift | ✅ SECURED | New secrets deployed |
| Application | ✅ UPDATED | Using new secrets |
| Prevention | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | .gitignore updated |

## 📝 INCIDENT TIMELINE

1. **Detection**: GitHub security alert for exposed secrets
2. **Response Time**: Immediate
3. **Remediation**: 
   - Secrets removed from repository
   - Git history cleaned
   - New secrets generated and deployed
   - Prevention measures implemented

## 🚀 VERIFICATION

Test that everything is working with new secrets:
```bash
# Check API health
curl https://pdf-slurper-v2-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/health

# Verify secrets are loaded (without exposing them)
oc exec deployment/pdf-slurper-v2 -n dept-barc -- env | grep -c "SECRET\|KEY\|JWT"
# Should return a count > 0
```

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process. Stay vigilant and keep secrets secret! 🔐
