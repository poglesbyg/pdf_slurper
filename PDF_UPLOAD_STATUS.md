# PDF Upload - Status Update

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Database Connection** - Fixed the path issue
2. **Upload Functionality** - PDFs upload successfully  
3. **Sample Detection** - Found 103 samples in the test PDF
4. **Submission Creation** - Creates submission records properly
5. **All Database Fields** - 37 columns ready in submission_v2 table

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The PDF text extraction logic needs adjustment. Currently extracting:
- ✅ Storage location (manually entered)
- ❌ Other PDF fields (not being extracted)

## 🔧 What Was Fixed Today

1. **Comprehensive Field Support**
   - Added all 19+ fields to models
   - Database schema updated with 37 columns
   - API schemas support all fields

2. **Database Issues**
   - Fixed "unable to open database file" error
   - Corrected database path configuration
   - Created tables with all required columns

3. **Frontend**
   - All pages have uniform structure
   - Upload page works correctly
   - Submission detail pages ready to display all fields

## 📝 Next Steps

The PDF extraction logic in `src/infrastructure/pdf/processor.py` needs to be adjusted to match the actual format of your PDFs. The extraction patterns may need to be customized for your specific PDF layout.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload PDFs**: Go to http://localhost:8080/upload
2. **View Submissions**: http://localhost:8080/submissions
3. **See Details**: Click on any submission to view

The system is ready - it just needs the PDF extraction patterns fine-tuned to match your specific PDF format!
