# âœ… Upload Page Fixed!

## Problem
The upload page at https://pdf-slurper-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/upload.html wasn't working.

## Root Cause
The `upload.html` file in the web pod was **empty (0 bytes)**. Additionally, the `index.html` was also empty, and `config.js` needed updates for proper API routing.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Deployed Proper Upload Page** âœ…
- Copied the complete `web-static/upload.html` (17.1KB) to the web pod
- The page now includes:
  - Drag & drop file upload
  - Storage location input (required)
  - QC threshold options
  - Progress indicators
  - Success/error messages

### 2. **Fixed Configuration** âœ…
- Updated `/config.js` to properly handle API paths
- Added backward compatibility
- Fixed URL construction for API calls

### 3. **Created Index Redirect** âœ…
- Deployed proper `index.html` that redirects to dashboard
- Previously was empty (0 bytes)

### 4. **Verified Upload Endpoint** âœ…
- Confirmed POST `/api/v1/submissions/` endpoint is working
- Successfully tested with real PDF file
- New submission created: `sub_fc6bce1bac9d` with 96 samples

## Test Results

```bash
âœ… Upload successful!
Submission ID: sub_fc6bce1bac9d
Sample count: 96
```

## Current Status

The upload page is now **fully functional** and available at:
**https://pdf-slurper-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/upload.html**
