# OpenShift Deployment - Final Fix Summary ✅

## All Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Web Dashboard Access Fixed
- **Issue**: 404 errors when accessing root URL
- **Fix**: Created proper routes for both web UI and API
- **Result**: Dashboard accessible at https://pdf-slurper-v2-dept-barc.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu/

### 2. ✅ Configuration File Added
- **Issue**: `config.js` was missing, causing JavaScript errors
- **Fix**: Created `config.js` with `API_CONFIG` object for API endpoint configuration
- **Result**: Dashboard can properly fetch data from API

### 3. ✅ Submissions Display Fixed
- **Issue**: Phantom/cached submissions with empty metadata
- **Fix**: Cleaned up phantom entries, restarted API to clear cache
- **Result**: Only real submissions with complete metadata are displayed

### 4. ✅ Samples Now Accessible
- **Issue**: Samples within submissions were unreachable
- **Fix**: Ensured proper database queries and API endpoints
- **Result**: All 96 samples are accessible for the test submission
